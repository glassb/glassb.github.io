<p> <b>Overview:</b> Townhouse LED colors' update every 60 seconds based on respective townhouse electricity usage. Current power (kW) usage is compared to average power from the previous 7 days (kW), and then converted to the red-green light spectrum. Green light means current energy is less than the 7-day average, and contrary, red denotes greater usage. Greater color intensity (e.g. a vibrant green) correlates to energy use extremity (e.g. very low energy use). A yellow tint denotes a similar current use to the baseline average for your suite. <br></p>
